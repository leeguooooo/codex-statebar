"""Import-time regression tests.

The status bar is invoked once per second at the user's `refreshInterval`,
so every module pulled in at import time multiplies its cost by 60×/min.
These tests pin which modules MUST stay out of the render-path import
graph. If a future change adds one of them back at module top, the test
fails — pushing the author to either lazy-import it or justify the cost.

Banned imports here are the ones we explicitly deferred in Phase A:
- importlib.metadata: 20ms cumulative (pulls email.message, zipfile, ...)
- subprocess: 8ms cumulative
- shutil: 6ms cumulative

We allow these to be imported by `cs --setup`, `cs doctor`, etc., but not
on the default render path that runs every second.

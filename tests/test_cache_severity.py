"""Direct unit tests for styles._cache_severity color contract.

The styles layer detects cache state by string content (`"m"`/`"h"` ⇒ green,
otherwise yellow, `"COLD"` ⇒ red). This is implicit coupling between the
formatter (core.get_cache_age_text) and the colorizer (styles._cache_severity).
These tests pin the contract directly so a future format change can't
silently miscolor without a test failure.

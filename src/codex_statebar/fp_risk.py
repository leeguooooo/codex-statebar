"""Relay fingerprint-risk warning line (``show_fp_risk``).

Claude Code embeds a per-request identity mark in the system prompt's
"Today's date is …" sentence when ``ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`` points off the
official host — one dimension of that mark is the system timezone (the date
separator flips to a slash for ``Asia/Shanghai`` / ``Asia/Urumqi``). That
mark rides in the outgoing request, which the status bar never sees or
touches, so this module does NOT detect or alter the mark. It only reads the
same local signals the user already controls — relay base URL + system
timezone — and surfaces "this setup is fingerprintable, ban risk" so the
user can make an informed call (the robust fix is the official endpoint).

"""Egress-IP risk segment (``show_ip_risk``).

Answers "how clean is the IP my traffic exits from right now?" — users on
relays/VPNs care because a dirty egress IP raises account-risk. Data source
is proxycheck.io's free tier (risk score 0-100 + proxy/VPN flag, no key
needed); the reference site the user compares against (ippure.com) hides its
API behind browser fingerprinting, so it can't back a CLI.

Same architecture as the relay-balance segment: the render path ONLY reads a
cache file; when the cache is stale a detached ``_ip_risk_refresh`` process
re-probes (two ~8s HTTP calls) and rewrites the cache. Nothing on the render
path ever touches the network. Probe cadence is IP_RISK_TTL_S (30 min) — the
user explicitly does not want per-render checking.

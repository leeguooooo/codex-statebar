"""Rate-limit forecast and end-of-window projection.

Projects each window's end-of-window usage from the AVERAGE pace *so far this
window*, not a noisy recent burst. A burst-rate extrapolation gets whipsawed by
the first few seconds of activity (and used_pct is a coarse integer step), so it
produced absurd ETAs ("~20m to the 7-day limit" off a 60s tick). The average
pace over the whole elapsed window is stable and self-correcting: idle time is
averaged in, so it answers the honest question "at the rate you've actually been
going this window, where will you end up — and will you hit the cap first?"

`resets_at` marks when the window resets; the window has been accumulating since
`resets_at - WINDOW_LEN_S`, so:

    elapsed   = window_len - time_to_reset
    avg_rate  = used_pct / elapsed                  # %/s over the window so far
    projected = used_pct + avg_rate * time_to_reset # == used * window_len / elapsed
    ttl       = (100 - used_pct) / avg_rate         # secs to 100% at that pace

Show an at-risk `~ETA` chip when `projected >= 100` (on track to exhaust before
reset). The separate always-visible `→NN%` projection keeps a small bounded
history to learn local work/off-hour bucket rates over time. Stdlib only;
lazy-imported on the render path. Fails safe: odd/insufficient input → None,
never raises.

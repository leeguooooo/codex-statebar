"""Thin status-line render client (Phase B).

Invoked by Claude Code on every statusline tick via ``cxs render``. Goal:
do as little Python as possible — just read the daemon's pre-rendered
output and print it. If the daemon is dead or its output is stale, fall
back transparently to the inline render path so the user never sees a
frozen or empty status line.

The thin client also forwards Claude Code's stdin payload to
``~/.cache/codex-statebar/last_stdin.json`` so the daemon sees fresh
``rate_limits`` / model / transcript_path on its next tick. Without this,
the daemon would keep re-rendering whatever snapshot was captured the
last time the inline path ran — token counters and 7d% would freeze.

Imports kept to bare stdlib (json, os, sys, time, pathlib) so the
import-time floor stays minimal. Heavier modules (core, styles, themes)
are deferred to the fallback path only.
